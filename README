Rails Api Doc Generator
Original Author: JPM van der Meer
Modified By: Chelsea Robb
=======================
With API DOC one can generate code for a Restful Rails API. 
It generates a set of HTML views in the public directory.  Parses the desired controllers and generates appropriate views.  
Currently does not read routes.rb and requires manual entry of routes

=INSTALL
    script/plugin install git@github.com:fmiopensource/rapi_doc.git

==Templates
Templates can be used for tuning your method generation and index.html.erb.

==Structure
In the structure folder one can setup some additional views to be used for the apidoc controller generator.

==Usage
In vendor/plugins/rapi_doc/tasks/rapi_doc.rake update the resources to reflect your desired resources to document
Invoke the generation by calling
    rake rapi_doc

EXAMPLE Method documentation

=begin apidoc
url:: /projects
method:: GET
access:: FREE
return:: [JSON|XML] - some project  
param:: page:int - the page
param:: per_page:int - max items per page

Get a list of projects. This method uses pagination. If you want to retreive project 1-10 for example:
/projects?page=1&per_page=10.
=end


TODO  - Update README to be more clear
      - Change where documentation gets generated to, right now it just generates to the script folder
      - Support multiple returns to explain reasons for error codes
      - Make class documentation work
      - Write tests and make them work
